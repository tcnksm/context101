# go context 101

This is sample codes of explaining Go1.7 [context](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/context/) package. Complete explaination is on my blog article [http://deeeet.com/writing/2016/07/22/context/](http://deeeet.com/writing/2016/07/22/context/) (This is written in Japanese. I will write it in English soon)

Now codes are not well organized. I will fix it to be more clear to understand soon.
